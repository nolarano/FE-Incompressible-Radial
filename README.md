# FE-Radial-TumorGrowth
Radially Symmetric Solid Tumor Growth with Thermo-mechanically Consistent Framework.

For incompressible solid tumor growth simulation, run main2.m file with preferred parameters. The outputs are defined in ./solver/radial_time_evolution2.m.

For compressible solid tumor growth simulation, run compressible_1d_equilcouple_evol_gel.m.

The data for the best fitting is also provided in ./data_as_diameters which obtained by extracting from figures in the refereces below using WebPlotDigitizer.
